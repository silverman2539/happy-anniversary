		<p style="font-size:25px; border-bottom:solid; border-color:lightcoral; border-width:thin; padding:15px;">Happy Anniversary!</p>
		<p style="font-size:25;">March 22</p>
		<p>To my love,</p>
		<p>Do you like this font? Iâ€™ve decided Iâ€™m gonna write you a bunch of letters and each one will have a different font. You can let me know which font is your favorite so that if I type more things for you Iâ€™ll know what to use. This font is sacramento, let me know what you think of it. Also Iâ€™m gonna include the alphabet at the end of this so that you can take a look at how this font makes all the letters look. So far Iâ€™m not loving it but Iâ€™m also not hating it. But obviously the font is not the important point of this letter. The point is that I love you.</p>
		<p>So Iâ€™ve been thinking and I think you should just move in with me. So far, itâ€™s only been like a week since I last saw you and Iâ€™m already dying. I enjoy when we do Hangouts calls, it makes me a little less sad. But Iâ€™ve been really struggling the last couple of days, and youâ€™ve been really helping me. I have no idea how long itâ€™ll be after I write this before you actually get to read it, so Iâ€™m just gonna update you on what day it is. Two days ago was when we were talking about stuff for like a while, and it was the day that I was like convinced you were gonna break up with me (thank god you didnâ€™t). And last night you also helped me with stuff and itâ€™s when we talked on the phone and I was crying a bunch. So yeah basically youâ€™ve just been really great the past couple of days and youâ€™ve been helping me work through my problems. And you believe in me so much more than I ever could. I really appreciate you being in my life and I have literally no idea what I would do without you. Youâ€™re so amazing.</p>
		<p>Also yesterday we were doing a call on Hangouts and it was pretty fun. We talked for like three hours and I loved it. And there were a few minutes when we werenâ€™t wearing shirts and then I saw your tits! That was fun but kinda scary for some reason. But I just really like doing Hangouts calls with you because then I get to hear your voice and see you. When we do phone calls I donâ€™t get to see you. ðŸ˜¢ Also I figured out how to use emojis on my computer so Iâ€™m pretty happy about that. But back to the point, Hangouts calls are fun. And yesterday when we were talking we kept typing things instead of using real talking words.</p>
		<p>I wish we could be together. I guess once youâ€™re reading this we will have been together at least a little bit. But right now, as Iâ€™m writing this, I just canâ€™t wait for the next time weâ€™re together. I think a lot about whatâ€™ll happen the next time I see you. I think weâ€™ll kiss a lot. The longer Iâ€™m away from you, the more I want to do with you. And I think you might feel the same way. Because the other day you said if we were together you would have wanted to have sex but I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s accurate. I think you were just missing me and that made you think you wanted something that you didnâ€™t actually want. But however you felt is fine obviously, I just think I know how you felt but I want you to let me know if thatâ€™s accurate.</p>
		<p>Also, this is unrelated, but Iâ€™m watching a show and this lady didnâ€™t feel like dealing with her baby so she told the maid to take her baby away whenever she hears the baby crying. Isnâ€™t that horrible? Weâ€™ll be much better parents than that. Do you still wanna get married and have kids and stuff? Because I feel like you might have changed your mind, and I certainly have not. I would love to spend the rest of my life with you. Especially because I havenâ€™t seen you in a week and itâ€™s horrible so I know I couldnâ€™t handle being away from you for longer than that. If this whole corona thing lasts for too much longer Iâ€™m gonna die. Iâ€™m literally about to cry as I write this because Iâ€™m sad not seeing you.</p>
		<p>Normally I would try to write more but I think itâ€™s okay for me not to because by the time you get this, thereâ€™s gonna be more letters for you to read. Some of them might be longer but maybe some will be shorter. I hope you enjoy everything I write you. And I hope you enjoy all the bracelets. Iâ€™m planning on making you more presents too but at this point I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m gonna make you. Also you probably forgot about the thing I said at the beginning about leaving the alphabet at the end of this, so Iâ€™m just reminding you so that you donâ€™t question what itâ€™s about.</p>
		<p>I love you,</p>
		<p>Your wonderful girlfriend ðŸ’–</p>
		<br>
		<p>P.S. I donâ€™t particularly enjoy the look of that heart. On my phone itâ€™s pink! Pink is so niceâ€¦ Red is cool too but pink is definitely better. I love you! Bye!</p>
