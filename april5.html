		<p style="font-size:25px; border-bottom:solid; border-color:lightcoral; border-width:thin; padding:15px;">Happy Anniversary!</p>
		<p style="font-size:25;">April 5</p>
		<p>To Scout,</p>
		<p>Okay so first of all, this font is called Lobster and I think that‚Äôs so funny. Also last night was when you said I can call you Scout when we‚Äôre alone so I decided that‚Äôs how I would address this letter to you. I like the name Scout, and I‚Äôm totally on board with it if you would prefer to have that as your name, but right now you just don‚Äôt have a name for your contact in my phone and it‚Äôs confusing. Because I changed it to ‚ÄúMy baby üíñ‚Äù but everytime you text me it takes me a minute to realize who it is. I feel like I should know but for some reason it just always confuses me. But it‚Äôll be fine once I get used to it. And if you decide to tell other people to call you Scout then I can just make that your name in my phone but for now I‚Äôll just be confused everytime you text me.</p>
		<p>This time, I actually have a point to writing you a letter! The point is that I was watching Jurassic World with Alex, because he‚Äôs obsessed with dinosaurs and this movie is so much better than dinosaur shows made for children. But anyway, the big mean dinosaur (whose name I cannot spell) hurt Blue and I literally almost cried even though I‚Äôve seen the movie multiple times and I know that she ends up being fine. I think I cry too much about what happens in movies but I think it‚Äôs fine. Also I realized that I don‚Äôt remember watching the latest Jurassic World movie. Because the original Jurassic Park movies have been out for years and I was obsessed when I was younger so I‚Äôve seen those a million times. And Jurassic World is Alex‚Äôs favorite dinosaur movie so I‚Äôve seen it like three times in the past couple of weeks. But I think I‚Äôve only seen the second Jurassic World movie a couple times so I honestly don‚Äôt remember what happens in it. So guess what I‚Äôm about to watch now.</p>
		<p>There is another thing I wanted to write about. Tomorrow we will have been dating for ten months. That‚Äôs really exciting to me. I would love to write you a letter tomorrow about how exciting it is but I‚Äôm busy tomorrow. My dad bought cookie batter and told me that I have to make him cookies so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing tomorrow. And Lucas is going to help me because we‚Äôre getting along. But I am really happy that we‚Äôve been dating for so long. I guess by the time you read this we‚Äôll have been dating for at least 11 months, maybe even a year. But we‚Äôre supposed to go back to school around the time that we‚Äôll have been dating for 11 months, but we probably won‚Äôt be back in school by then.</p>
		<p>I‚Äôve really enjoyed all the time that we‚Äôve been together. You truly make me happier than I have ever been. I love you with all my heart and I hope that you never forget that. I would love to spend the rest of my life with you. I‚Äôm planning on being with you forever, and I hope that you always feel that way too. I can picture how happy I‚Äôm going to be when I wake up next to you every morning.</p>
		<p>Okay also I‚Äôm watching the second Jurassic World movie and now I absolutely remember it existing. Now I remember that I saw it with Courtney and then we talked during the movie even though that‚Äôs not allowed. And there‚Äôs a part where the lady named Claire tells the dude that they broke up because he wouldn‚Äôt let her drive the van and I remember thinking that was funny.</p>
		<p>From,</p>
		<p>Me (you know who it‚Äôs from)</p>
